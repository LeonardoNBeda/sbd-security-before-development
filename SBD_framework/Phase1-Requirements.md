## Overview - Phase 1: Security Requirements

The **Security Requirements** phase is vital for embedding security early in the product development lifecycle. This phase focuses on establishing baseline security requirements for secure development, cloud infrastructure, compliance with relevant standards, and robust cryptography for data protection.

During this phase, the AppSec team collaborates with development and operations teams to integrate security and privacy considerations into the product from the outset. This includes specifying requirements for secure coding, cloud architecture, data encryption, and compliance with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and others.

## Goals of the Security Requirements Phase

The primary objectives of this phase are to:

1. **Define Secure Development Practices**: Establish coding guidelines and practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
2. **Set Cloud Infrastructure Security Requirements**: Ensure cloud environments (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) are securely configured, adhering to the principle of least privilege, network segmentation, and secure identity management.
3. **Compliance and Regulatory Adherence**: Confirm that the product meets relevant compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), covering data privacy, encryption, logging, and auditing.
4. **Data Encryption and Privacy**: Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit, ensuring personal data is protected according to privacy-by-design principles.
5. **Threat Modeling and Risk Management**: Initiate threat modeling to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities that may need addressing throughout the lifecycle.

## Key Questions for Development and Operations Teams

The following questions ensure that security requirements are well understood and implemented during this phase:

### 1. **Secure Development Practices**
- What secure coding guidelines are being followed by the development teams? (e.g., OWASP Top 10, SANS CWE Top 25)
- How are code reviews conducted to identify security vulnerabilities early?
- Are tools in place to automatically scan code for security issues? (e.g., static code analysis, SAST)
- How are dependency vulnerabilities managed, and are third-party libraries kept up to date?

### 2. **Cloud Infrastructure Security**
- What cloud platforms will be utilized, and how is access managed?
- What measures enforce least privilege for cloud resources and services?
- How is network segmentation configured within the cloud environment?
- Are protections in place for APIs, containers, and microservices (e.g., WAF, API gateways)?
- How are logging, monitoring, and alerting configured to detect suspicious activities or security incidents?

### 3. **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**
- What legal and regulatory requirements must the product comply with (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?
- How are these requirements integrated into the design and development processes?
- What measures are in place to log and audit access to sensitive data?
- How are data subject requests (e.g., access, deletion) managed, and are these processes automated?

### 4. **Data Encryption and Protection**
- How is data encrypted both at rest and in transit?
- Are industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+) utilized?
- How are encryption keys managed, and who has access to them?
- How is sensitive data (e.g., PII) anonymized or pseudonymized when appropriate?
- Are there mechanisms for securely wiping data once it is no longer needed?

### 5. **Threat Modeling and Risk Management**
- Has threat modeling been conducted for this product, and what threats were identified?
- What mitigations have been implemented to address identified risks?
- Are there disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in case of a security incident?
- How are security vulnerabilities tracked, and what is the process for patching them?

## Artifacts to Provide

During the **Security Requirements** phase, the following artifacts must be provided to the AppSec team to ensure that security, compliance, and data protection measures are adequately planned and implemented:

### ✅ **1. Secure Coding Guidelines**
   - **Required**: Documentation outlining the secure development practices and coding standards to be followed (e.g., OWASP Top 10). This includes guidelines on secure authentication, error handling, and input validation.  
   **Responsible Party**: Development Team & AppSec Team (Provide the Guidelines)

### ✅ **2. Cloud Security Architecture**
   - **Required**: A high-level architectural diagram illustrating the cloud infrastructure, including network segmentation, access controls, and data flow between different services and APIs. This should also encompass any security services like firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS).  
   **Responsible Party**: Enterprise Architecture, Cloud Architects & DevOps Team

### ✅ **3. Encryption Plan**
   - **Optional**: A detailed encryption strategy outlining how data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. This includes information on the encryption protocols used, how encryption keys are managed, and policies for data encryption.  
   **Responsible Party**: Security Architect & Development Team

### ✅ **4. Compliance Matrix**
   - **Optional**: A document mapping relevant compliance and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) to the security controls in place. This ensures that security measures align with legal obligations, particularly for data protection and privacy.  
   **Responsible Party**: Compliance Officer & AppSec Team

### ✅ **5. Threat Model**
   - **Required**: A comprehensive threat model identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities associated with the product. This should include a list of mitigations and controls to address identified risks.  
   **Responsible Party**: Enterprise Architecture, AppSec Team & Development Team

### ✅ **6. Risk Register**
   - **Required**: A register that tracks security risks throughout the project lifecycle. This document should include identified risks, their potential impact, and corresponding mitigation plans.  
   **Responsible Party**: Risk Management Team & AppSec Team

### ✅ **7. Data Flow Diagram**
   - **Required**: A diagram outlining how data flows through the system, identifying sensitive data points, third-party integrations, and locations where data is processed, stored, and encrypted.  
   **Responsible Party**: Development Team & Data Protection Officer

### ✅ **8. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans**
   - **Optional**: A plan outlining the steps to take in the event of a security breach, including disaster recovery strategies and business continuity measures. It should detail how quickly the system can recover and what actions are necessary to mitigate data loss or exposure.  
   **Responsible Party**: Operations Team & AppSec Team

## Conclusion

The **Security Requirements** phase is crucial for ensuring that security and privacy considerations are integrated into the product from the beginning. By defining secure development practices, setting clear requirements for cloud infrastructure, and addressing compliance and encryption, the AppSec team can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. By the end of this phase, developers should have a comprehensive understanding of their responsibilities in ensuring the product is secure and compliant with applicable regulations.
