## Overview - Phase 3: Development

The **Development** phase is vital for ensuring adherence to secure coding practices and for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities before software deployment. This phase encompasses code reviews and static code analysis to evaluate the code for security issues, performance bottlenecks, and compliance with established coding standards. The AppSec team plays a crucial role in overseeing these activities, ensuring that any vulnerabilities identified are effectively managed and remediated.

## Goals of the Development Phase

The primary objectives of this phase are to:

1. **Ensure Secure Coding Practices**: Validate that developers are following the secure coding guidelines established in earlier phases.
2. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Conduct thorough code reviews and static analysis to uncover security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the code.
3. **Manage Vulnerabilities**: Establish processes for handling identified vulnerabilities, including strategies for risk acceptance and remediation.

## Key Questions for AppSec Teams

The following questions help ensure that security concerns are effectively addressed during the development phase:

### 1. **Secure Coding Practices**
- **Required**: Are developers trained in secure coding practices and aware of the established guidelines?
- **Required**: What tools are being utilized to facilitate code reviews and static analysis?
- **Optional**: How frequently are code reviews conducted, and what is the process for peer reviews?
- **Optional**: Are specific metrics or KPIs in place to measure code quality and security?

### 2. **Vulnerability Identification**
- **Required**: What vulnerabilities have been identified during code reviews and static analysis?
- **Required**: How are these vulnerabilities categorized (e.g., critical, high, medium, low)?
- **Optional**: What process is followed to verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed?
- **Optional**: Are there any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies utilized in the project?

### 3. **Risk Acceptance and Vulnerability Management**
- **Required**: What is the process for accepting risks associated with identified vulnerabilities?
- **Required**: How are remediation timelines established for these vulnerabilities?
- **Optional**: Are there any risks deemed acceptable, and what is the rationale for these decisions?
- **Optional**: How is the status of vulnerabilities tracked throughout the development lifecycle?

## Artifacts to Provide

During the **Development** phase, the following artifacts must be provided to the AppSec team to ensure effective management of vulnerabilities and adherence to secure coding practices:

### ✅ **1. Code Review Reports**
   - Documentation detailing findings from code reviews, including identified vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.  
   **Responsible Party**: Development Team & AppSec Team

### ✅ **2. Static Code Analysis Reports**
   - Reports generated from static analysis tools, highlighting security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.  
   **Responsible Party**: Development Team & AppSec Team

### ✅ **3. Vulnerability Management Plan**
   - A plan outlining how identified vulnerabilities will be managed, including timelines for remediation and risk acceptance processes.  
   **Responsible Party**: AppSec Team & Development Team

### ✅ **4. Vulnerability Acceptance Document**
   - A document outlining any accepted vulnerabilities, including the justification for acceptance and implemented mitigation measures.  
   **Responsible Party**: AppSec Team & Risk Management Team

### ✅ **5. Risk Register Updates**
   - Updates to the risk register tracking identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and remediation status.  
   **Responsible Party**: Risk Management Team & AppSec Team

## Conclusion

The **Development** phase is crucial for ensuring that secure coding practices are followed and that vulnerabilities are effectively identified and managed. Through comprehensive code reviews and static analysis, teams can significantly reduce the risk of security issues in deployed software. By the end of this phase, developers and security teams should have a clear understanding of any vulnerabilities present in the code and a solid plan for addressing them before advancing to the next phase of the SSDLC.
