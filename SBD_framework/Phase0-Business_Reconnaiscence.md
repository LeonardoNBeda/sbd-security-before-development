## Overview - Phase 0: Business Reconnaissance

The **Business Reconnaissance** phase serves as the foundational step of the "Security Before Development" framework. During this phase, the AppSec team collaborates closely with product management, business stakeholders, and development teams to gain a comprehensive understanding of the product's business model, target audience, and operational environment.

This phase emphasizes identifying key business objectives, intended users, expected operational environments (internal vs. external use), and potential integrations with third-party partners or services. The insights gathered here help align security requirements with business goals, ensuring that potential risks are addressed from the outset.

## Goals of the Business Reconnaissance Phase

The primary objectives of the Business Reconnaissance phase are:

1. **Understand the Product's Purpose**: Clarify the product's core functionalities, its intended use, and its market position.
2. **Identify the Target Audience**: Define the primary users of the product (internal users, external customers, partners, etc.).
3. **Determine the Environment**: Establish whether the product will be used internally within the organization or externally by customers or partners.
4. **Assess Integration Points**: Identify any planned integrations with external partners, APIs, or third-party services that might influence security and privacy.
5. **Address Privacy Concerns**: Ensure that privacy by design is embedded in the product from the start, understanding how personal data will be handled and protected.
6. **Risk Profiling**: Begin assessing potential security risks based on the product's nature and environment.

## Key Questions for Development and Business Teams

To ensure that security and privacy considerations align with business needs, the development and business teams should address the following questions:

### 1. **Business Model and Product Objectives**
- What is the primary purpose of the product?
- What problem does the product solve, and what value does it provide to users or the business?
- What are the core functionalities of the product?
- How does this product align with the overall business strategy?

### 2. **Target Audience**
- Who is the primary audience for this product? (e.g., customers, employees, partners)
- Are there different user roles with varying levels of access?
- Will the product be publicly accessible or restricted to internal use only?

### 3. **Operational Environment**
- Is this product intended for internal use within the organization, or will it be used by external customers or partners?
- Will the product be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid solution?
- Are there regulatory or compliance requirements based on the target audience or geography?

### 4. **Integration and External Dependencies**
- Does the product integrate with third-party services or APIs?
- Will there be any partnerships involving data sharing or processing?
- Are there existing systems or platforms that this product will interface with?

### 5. **Security and Privacy Considerations**
- What types of data will the product collect, process, or store? Will it involve Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?
- How will user consent be managed for data collection, especially for PII?
- What mechanisms are in place to ensure data minimization and purpose limitation?
- How are user rights, such as access to data or the right to be forgotten, managed within the system?
- What measures are in place to handle potential data breaches, and how will users be notified in case of a privacy incident?

### 6. **Data Retention and Protection**
- How long will personal data be retained, and what policies govern its retention and deletion?
- Will data be encrypted at rest and in transit?
- What access control measures will be implemented to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information?
- How will data be anonymized or pseudonymized, if necessary?

### 7. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**
- Does the product need to comply with specific legal or regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)?
- What processes are in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws, including handling data subject access requests (DSARs)?
- What steps are being taken to ensure that cross-border data transfers comply with privacy regulations?

## Artifacts to Provide

During the **Business Reconnaissance** phase, the following artifacts should be gathered and documented to help AppSec teams understand the product and its context:

### ✅ **1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
   - **Required**: A document outlining the business objectives, product goals, and key functionalities. It should provide a comprehensive overview of what the product aims to achieve and how it aligns with the overall business strategy.  
   **Responsible Party**: Business and Product Team

### ✅ **2. Target Audience Profile**
   - **Required**: A description of the intended users of the product, including distinctions between internal and external audiences. This should detail user roles, access levels, and whether the product is aimed at employees, customers, or partners.  
   **Responsible Party**: Business and Product Team

### ✅ **3. Deployment Environment Overview**
   - **Required**: A detailed overview of where and how the product will be deployed, including whether it will be used internally within the organization, externally by customers or partners, and if it will be hosted on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid solution.  
   **Responsible Party**: Enterprise Architecture, Cloud Architects & DevOps Team

### ✅ **4. Third-Party Integration Plan**
   - **Required**: A plan outlining any integrations with external APIs, services, or third-party systems. This should include a data flow diagram illustrating how data is shared or processed across these integrations.  
   **Responsible Party**: Business, Product & Development Team

### ✅ **5. Data Classification and Regulatory Impact Analysis**
   - **Required**: A document that classifies the types of data the product will handle, especially sensitive data like PII. This should also include an assessment of the legal and regulatory implications (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) based on the product’s target audience and operational regions.  
   **Responsible Party**: Enterprise Architecture, Compliance, Product Team & Data Privacy Team

### ✅ **6. Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**
   - **Required**: An assessment focused on how the product collects, stores, uses, and protects personal data. It should include an analysis of privacy risks and the steps needed to mitigate them, ensuring compliance with relevant privacy regulations.  
   **Responsible Party**: Business, Product Team & Data Privacy Team

### ✅ **7. Consent Management Plan**
   - **Required**: A comprehensive plan outlining how user consent will be obtained, stored, and managed. This is crucial for complying with privacy laws such as GDPR, especially when collecting or processing personal data.  
   **Responsible Party**: Business, Product Team & Data Privacy Team

### ✅ **8. Risk Profile**
   - **Required**: A high-level document outlining potential security and privacy risks. It should provide an initial risk assessment based on the product’s purpose, target audience, and operational environment, serving as a foundation for future threat modeling and architectural reviews.  
   **Responsible Party**: Application Security, Cyber Risk Team & Data Privacy Team

## Conclusion

The **Business Reconnaissance** phase is a crucial starting point for embedding security and privacy into the product's lifecycle. By gaining a thorough understanding of the business context, AppSec teams can better define security requirements, align them with business goals, and ensure that security risks are addressed early in the SSDLC.

This phase also lays the groundwork for future security and privacy activities, such as threat modeling and architectural reviews, by clarifying how the product operates and the potential security implications of its business model.
