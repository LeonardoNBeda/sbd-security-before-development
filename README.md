**Title**: Security Before Development: A Framework for Embedding Security in the Software Development Lifecycle  
**Subtitle**: Enhancing Application Security Through Proactive Measures and Collaboration  

## Overview

"Security Before Development" is a framework designed to assist Application Security (AppSec) teams in organizing, requesting, and managing documentation and evidence throughout the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC). This framework improves collaboration between AppSec and development teams by clearly defining the security and privacy information that development teams need to provide before and during the software development process.

This framework ensures that critical security practices such as **Security by Design** and **Privacy by Design** are embedded into the software lifecycle from the earliest stages of planning and design, creating a structured and repeatable process to achieve secure software development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of "Security Before Development" is to establish clear and organized communication between AppSec teams and development teams, ensuring that security requirements are understood and met before coding begins. It introduces standardized processes for gathering evidence and documentation, ensuring that security is a foundational component of all phases of the SSDLC.

This framework helps achieve the following:

- **Clarity**: Ensures development teams understand the exact security and privacy information they must provide.
- **Compliance**: Provides a structured process for ensuring compliance with security standards, privacy regulations, and best practices.
- **Early Security Involvement**: Encourages security to be considered in the early stages of design and planning.
- **Consistency**: Provides standardized checklists and templates for gathering security-related evidence.
  
## Benefits

1. **Security by Design**: Establishes a foundation for security in the architecture and design stages, ensuring vulnerabilities are mitigated from the outset.
2. **Privacy by Design**: Integrates privacy considerations into the design of the system, ensuring data protection and compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
3. **Improved Collaboration**: Fosters better communication between AppSec and development teams by clarifying expectations, reducing misunderstandings.
4. **Streamlined Security Processes**: Simplifies the collection of security artifacts, making security assessments easier and faster.
5. **Proactive Risk Management**: Allows AppSec teams to identify and mitigate security risks before they are introduced into the development process.

## Conclusion

"Security Before Development" is a proactive approach to embedding security into the software development process by making sure all the necessary requirements, documentation, and security controls are in place before coding begins. This framework encourages close collaboration between AppSec and development teams, ensuring that security and privacy are considered from the very start of the project, which reduces vulnerabilities and security risks during and after development.

By following this framework, teams can ensure that security becomes a priority throughout the SSDLC and not an afterthought.
